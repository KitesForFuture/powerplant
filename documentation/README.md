# Fly a Plane

* Control surfaces should be deflected as little as possible to prevent drag and as slowly as possible to reduce wear on the servo motors

## Controlling the Height

## Controlling the Roll Angle

* The roll angle is adjusted using the ailerons.
* Constant aileron deflection causes a constant angular rolling velocity after a short time of angular rolling acceleration. So most of the rolling movement is done with constant aileron deflection. The roll deceleration can be achieved with a D-Term that's invisible while ailerons are maximally deflected during most of the rolling movement.
* Adverse Yaw must be accounted for by "differentiation", i.e. adding a fraction of the absolute value of the calculated deflection to both ailerons ( pitching them both up ). A higher angle of attack demands a higher differentiation.
